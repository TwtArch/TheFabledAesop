I'm off to have my muesli and sliced racist trope.  Back soon!

Monkey should maybe send two fingers instead but I'm sending them to you now. 🍒

'stuff' going on?  And know who are actually the good guys (and gals)?
* [29 April 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429084635/https://twitter.com/TheFabledAesop/status/1387689692259397632) ([live](https://twitter.com/TheFabledAesop/status/1387677871691517953)): You? Yes. Now run along.

Both deeply committed antiracists having a Twitter exchange.   Which is why Lou defended them.  That's cos she's a deeply committed antiracist too. Bye.

If you can't see the banana connection I can't help you.  But deeply committed antiracists are now being branded as racist using out of context screenshots and that's my last tweet to you. Bye.

I can assure you you're backing the wrong horse and I wasted much of yesterday on this not wasting today. But those being branded racist are the very opposite and someone has her own agenda it seems. Don't believe me, not my prob.

Don't bother piling on me,  I had that yesterday and I am simply blocking anyone today who does.

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? NO IT'S A FRUIT BASED TROPE apparently.  #nuts
