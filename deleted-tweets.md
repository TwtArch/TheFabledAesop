She needs to stay off Twitter & get serious help for her problem with truth telling. A fantasist & attention seeker. A danger to innocent others.

You've lied so much, about many people, hard to know when you're telling the truth & when you aren't. So you have a therapist? Good.

Monkey should maybe send two fingers instead but I'm sending them to you now. 🍒

I can assure you you're backing the wrong horse and I wasted much of yesterday on this not wasting today. But those being branded racist are the very opposite and someone has her own agenda it seems.
